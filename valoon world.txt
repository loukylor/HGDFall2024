turrets
 - with voice lines like searching for target
 - add easteregg so every now and then it says something different

walls taht close in on you
 - time restrictions in general
 - shoot things while flying through the air

targetable things always come from the same direction, so it's not cumbersome to cycle
 - targets/buttons on the walls

enemies
 - funni voicelines like h3vr
 - probably pretty fragile?
 - probably bad ai (not very threatening)
 - sometimes bleed on death instead of balloon particles lmfao

fans
 - sometimes stop to take a breath

pickups like armor or health

maybe one long level with a story?
 - intermitent saves?

SCREEN SHAKE 
 - be execessive

think of things to fill in the silence

instead of targetables maybe weapons will be in the same slot at the blower
 - gun will have excessive push, but is obviously powerfu
 - electric gun will have no push at all, but is still powerful, less range
